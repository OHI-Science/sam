## Objectives

Following the [OHI Global Goal Models, Data, and Gaps presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1myCjWaUp6kXGMJbBOE3kOoZO_-miicKluN_2hlzcFVo/edit#slide=id.g37b2a5357d_0_288), let's explore the OHI Global data for Samoa.

----

## Gapfilling in Samoa

Let's look a bit deeper to see numerically the percent gapfilling by goal to help us prioritize which goals we want to explore more deeply. We can pull directly from the data from the [Frazier et al. 2015](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0160377) publication. 

It's interesting to compare the percent gapfilling by goal to the scores by goal. Let's look at this both as a table and as a figure and discuss what you see. 

### Table: % Gapfilled vs. Scores

Here is this information as a table.

```{r scores_gf table, echo=FALSE}
## gapfilled scores
scores_gf <- scores_gf_csv %>% 
  filter(region_id == rgn_global$rgn_id,
         dimension == "status") %>%
  select(goal, percent_gapfilled = score) %>%
  arrange(percent_gapfilled) 

## scores
scores <- scores_csv %>% 
  filter(region_id == rgn_global$rgn_id,
         dimension == "status",  
         year == max(year)) %>%
  select(goal, score) %>%
  arrange(goal) 

## left join
scores_plot <- scores %>%
  left_join(scores_gf, by = "goal") %>% 
  arrange(percent_gapfilled)

## custom arrange: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26548495/reorder-rows-using-custom-order
targets_order <-  c("FP", "FIS", "MAR", "AO", "NP", "CS", "CP", "TR", "LE", "ECO", "LIV", "SP", "LSP", "ICO", "CW", "BD", "HAB", "SPP")
 
scores_plot <- scores_plot %>%
  mutate(targets_id =  factor(goal, levels = targets_order)) %>%
  arrange(targets_id) %>%
  select(-targets_id)

## display
scores_plot %>% 
  DT::datatable()
```

<br>

### Figure: % Gapfilled vs. Status Scores

It can also be nice to see it as a figure. There are a few places where there are overlaps because goals have the exact same scores.

```{r plot scores_gf, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
## hack for not overlapping labels
scores_plot_noBDFP <- scores_plot %>%
  filter(!goal %in% c("FP", "BD"))
scores_plot_BDFP <- scores_plot %>%
  filter(goal %in% c("FP", "BD"))

ggplot(data = scores_plot_noBDFP, aes(x = score, y = percent_gapfilled, label = goal)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_text(aes(label = goal), nudge_x = 2, nudge_y = 2) +
  geom_point(data = scores_plot_BDFP) +
  geom_text(data = scores_plot_BDFP, aes(label = goal), nudge_x = -2, nudge_y = -3) +
  xlab("status score") +
  ylab("percent gapfilled")
```


## Gapfilling Observations

Let's brainstorm together: let's list overall observations and observations by goal. Then we will prioritize which to dive deeply into and look at the underlying data with the time we have.

<br> 

<!--- photo interlude --->

![](images/ci_78365275_Medium.jpg)

<br> 

Here are some of the things that we discussed, I'll update this to include everything we talked about.

### Overall 

**Observations:**

- Two goals are 100% gapfilled (TR, HAB)
- Samoa has a lot of goals (~11) with scores over 50 (on the x-axis)
- There are ~7 goals where % gapfilling is under 12.5% (on the y-axis)
- Some high-scoring goals have high % gapfilling, some have low

<br>

### Tourism and Recreation (TR)

**Observations:**

- TR has the highest amount of gapfilling compared to any goal. 

<br>

### Habitat-based goals (HAB, CS, CP)

**Observations**:

- HAB is the goal with the highest amount of gapfilling and highest score
- CP, CS, and HAB rely on much of the same data. 

<br>

### Food Provision (FP)

**Observations**:

- FP and FIS are plotted on top of each other, which means that the FP score is the same as FIS (we can also see this from the table above). This means that MAR contributes nothing to the FP score, and in fact the MAR score is 0. 

<br>

### Lasting Special Places (LSP)

**Observations**:

- LSP has a very low score, and is not gapfilled. 

<br>

### Species-based goals (ICO, SPP)

- these scores are quite high and are not gapfilled (0). 

<br>

### [Artisanal Fishing Opportunities (AO)](http://ohi-science.org/ohi-global/goals.html#artisanal_fishing_opportunity)

**Observations**:

- This is not gapfilled, meaning that the data was not gapfilled by OHI. Data for access comes from survey data (Mora et al) and need comes from GDPpcPPP as a proxy for subsistence fishing need (World Bank).

<br>

### Livelihoods and Economies (LE, LIV, ECO)

**Observations**:

- The LE goal is not on the figure. We didn't include them in our gapfilling analyses because our models rely on old data (pre-2012). 

<br>

Now, where should we start? What order should we discuss these?

----

## Data discussion: deep dive

Let's look into the data behind some of these goals. 

We will use several resources for each goal, all linked from [ohi-science.org/ohi-global](http://ohi-science.org/ohi-global]): 

- [ohi-science.org/ohi-global/goals](http://ohi-science.org/ohi-global/goals)
- [ohi-science.org/ohi-global/layers_table.html](http://ohi-science.org/ohi-global/layers_table.html)
- [Global supplemental information](https://rawgit.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/draft/global_supplement/Supplement.html)

<br>

## [Food Provision: Fisheries](http://ohi-science.org/ohi-global/goals.html#food_provision:_fisheries)

**Questions:**

- Which species are included in the FIS calculation? Where do the data come from?

<br>

<!----
#### Global Model

To refresh our minds, we can look at [ohi-science.org/ohi-global/goals](http://ohi-science.org/ohi-global/goals#food_provision:_fisheries)

> "The model assess the amount of wild-caught seafood that can be sustainably harvested, with sustainability based on multi-species yield, and with penalties assigned for both over- and under-harvesting. Each taxa landed within each FAO major fishing area is assessed separately based on B/BMSY (maxium sustainable yield) and weighted by its relative contribution to overall catch. The goal status score for each reporting region in each year was calculated as the geometric mean of the all stock status scores."

The Fisheries (FIS) subgoal measures wildcaught fish catch within your EEZ (if your country fishes outside the EEZ and lands that catch in your country, that is not included). Our models need catch for at least 10 years (20 is better). Ideally, we would also have status of each species stock (at least B/BMSY, bonus is F/FMSY). We use both catch and B/BMSY information when we have it, but for some species we only have catch data. 

<  !---

Depending on the format, we'd be able to update data for those species, recalculate either with only those species, or mix-and-match SAUP and local data.

*Note*: we cannot add new species in this workshop, that is for Tier 2. That will take more attention and time than we can give. We would need to add meancatch values, as well as matching b_bmsy estimates.

--->

#### Global Data

Global data are from the [Sea Around Us Project](http://www.seaaroundus.org). Many species do not have formal stock assessments, but they do have tons of catch through time. The criteria we use for our fisheries model is data that has:

- **catch by species**: only what is fished within Samoa's EEZ
- **years**: at least 10 years of data (preferably 20)


We can look at these data in several ways. Let's start by looking on SAUP's website at an interactive visualization of [fish caught in Samoa's EEZ](http://www.seaaroundus.org/data/#/eez/882?chart=catch-chart&dimension=taxon&measure=tonnage&limit=20):

![](images/saup-samoa-eezfishing.png)

We can also look at an interactive visualization of [Samoa fishing around the world](http://www.seaaroundus.org/data/#/spatial-catch?entities=192) (mostly high seas and agreements with other countries). So although Samoa fishes further than its own EEZ, we don't include a lot of that catch. 

![](images/saup-samoa-worldfishing.png)

<br>

Let's look through the species listed and see if there are any included that don't represent Samoa's fisheries within the EEZ; we can remove them (but we can't add additional species in this workshop). 

Then, we can look at the mean catch estimates for certain species, especially for catch that is grouped instead of by species. If better local data are available, we can try to substitute these data.

#### Mean catch 

The mean catch layer ([fis_meancatch](https://github.com/OHI-Science/sam/blob/master/eez/layers/fis_meancatch.csv)) is in some ways a historic list because it includes species that may not be caught any more (i.e. was fished in the past and stopped for some reason). It is calculated as the average (mean) of each species' catch through time, so if it was a big catch in the past but now is 0, it will still average (it keeps all species in the dataset).

It will be more useful for us to look at the raw catch values, and see if any of them don't seem right. 

<!---
We can then recalculate mean_catch for the Toolbox. Not sure we can do this on the fly: We would have to look at this more carefully and this is where it would occur

If wanted to substitute new species data, don't add it to mean_catch; add it to the raw and then recalculate using this.
https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohiprep_v2018/blob/master/globalprep/fis/v2017/catch_data_prep.Rmd
--->


<!---

```{r fis_meancatch list, echo=FALSE}
fis_meancatch <- fis_meancatch_csv %>%
  filter(rgn_id == rgn_global$rgn_id) %>%
  mutate(stock_name = str_remove_all(stock_id_taxonkey, "-[0-9]+_[0-9]+"))

taxon_lookup <- taxon_lookup_csv %>%
  mutate(stock_name = str_replace(sciname, " ", "_"))

fis_meancatch_lookup <- left_join(
  fis_meancatch %>%
    distinct(stock_name),
  taxon_lookup, by = "stock_name") %>%
  select(stock_name, common)

## display as interactive DT table
fis_meancatch_lookup %>%
  DT::datatable()

## save as csv: 
fis_meancatch_lookup %>% write_csv("data/fis_meancatch_lookup_sam.csv")
```

There are `r fis_meancatch_lookup %>% nrow()` species in the [fis_meancatch](https://github.com/OHI-Science/sam/blob/master/eez/layers/fis_meancatch.csv) layer for Samoa.

We can look at this another way in the presentation.

--->
#### Raw catch data

To understand mean catch, dive into catch by species. 

Let's do two things. First, look through the list of species to see if any of them should be removed.

<!--- downloaded from Mazu git-annex/globalprep/fis/v2017/int/stock_catch_by_rgn.csv, filtered for sam and saved locally in sam/data --->

```{r stock_catch_by_rgn.csv, echo=FALSE}
stock_sam <- readr::read_csv("data/stock_catch_by_rgn_sam.csv")
# View(stock_sam)

## run this and then copy to presentation, I pasted it into TextWrangler first https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1myCjWaUp6kXGMJbBOE3kOoZO_-miicKluN_2hlzcFVo/edit#slide=id.g39ed252120_0_195
# stock_sam %>% 
#   distinct(taxon_scientific_name, taxon_common_name) %>%
#   as.data.frame()
```

There are `r n_distinct(stock_sam$taxon_scientific_name)` unique species. 

Let's look at them in the [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1myCjWaUp6kXGMJbBOE3kOoZO_-miicKluN_2hlzcFVo/edit#slide=id.g39ed252120_0_195) since there are so many.

<br>

Do we want to look at the timeseries for any species? For example:

```{r stock_catch_by_rgn.csv2, echo=FALSE}
stock_sam %>%
  filter(taxon_scientific_name == "Acanthuridae") %>%
  select(year, taxon_scientific_name, taxon_common_name, tons, stock_id) %>%
  DT::datatable()

```

#### B/Bmsy

These are the species stocks that we have data for [fis_b_bmsy](https://github.com/OHI-Science/sam/blob/master/eez/layers/fis_b_bmsy.csv):

```{r fis_b_bmsy list, echo=FALSE}
fis_b_bmsy <- fis_b_bmsy_csv %>%
  filter(rgn_id == rgn_global$rgn_id) %>%
  mutate(stock_name = str_remove_all(stock_id, "-[0-9]+"))

taxon_lookup <- taxon_lookup_csv %>%
  mutate(stock_name = str_replace(sciname, " ", "_"))

fis_b_bmsy_lookup <- left_join(
  fis_b_bmsy %>%
    distinct(stock_name), 
  taxon_lookup, by = "stock_name") %>%
  select(stock_name, common)
  
## display as interactive DT table
fis_b_bmsy_lookup %>%
  DT::datatable()

## save as csv:
fis_b_bmsy_lookup %>% write_csv("data/fis_b_bmsy_lookup_sam.csv")
```

Let's also look at these in the [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1myCjWaUp6kXGMJbBOE3kOoZO_-miicKluN_2hlzcFVo/edit#slide=id.g39ed252120_0_195).


There are only `r fis_b_bmsy_lookup %>% nrow()` species in the [fis_b_bmsy](https://github.com/OHI-Science/sam/blob/master/eez/layers/fis_b_bmsy.csv) layer for Samoa.

Let's look at these too. Are there any species that don't seem right?

<!---
If we want to look up b_bmsy for a single species, like red snapper (*Xiphias_gladius-77*):

```{r fis_b_bmsy sp, echo=FALSE}
fis_b_bmsy %>%
  filter(stock_id == "Xiphias_gladius-77") %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

--->

<!---

#### Gapfilling

Which FIS species are gapfilled?

```{r fis_b_bmsy gf list, echo=FALSE}
## change this to 
fis_b_bmsy_gf <- fis_b_bmsy_gf_csv %>%  
  filter(region_id == rgn_global$rgn_id) 

fis_b_bmsy_gf %>%
  filter(gapfilled == 1) %>%
  DT::datatable()

```

The proportion of gapfilled : not gapfilled is: `r fis_b_bmsy_gf %>% filter(gapfilled == 1) %>% nrow()` : `r fis_b_bmsy_gf %>% filter(gapfilled == 0) %>% nrow()`

All b_bmsy values are gapfilled. 

We don't have information on the catch that is gapfilled.
--->

#### Discussion

- Are there any species that don't seem right and we should remove, for meancatch or B/Bmsy?
- There are many categories that we only have information at the genus or family levels. Do you have information for species level?


<br>

## [Food Provision: Mariculture](http://ohi-science.org/ohi-global/goals.html#food_provision:_mariculture)

**Questions:**

- Why is the MAR score 0?

### Global Data 

#### Tonnes of Harvest

Let's look at the list of species that are represented in the MAR model as tonnes of harvest: (the [mar_harvest_tonnes](https://github.com/OHI-Science/sam/blob/master/eez/layers/mar_harvest_tonnes.csv) layer). 

***Note! In 2018 Seaweed will also be included if this is reported for Samoa)

```{r mar_harvest_tonnes, echo=FALSE}
mar_harvest_tonnes <- mar_harvest_tonnes_csv %>%
  filter(rgn_id == rgn_global$rgn_id) %>%
  mutate(taxa = str_remove_all(taxa_code, "_.*"))

## display as interactive DT table
  mar_harvest_tonnes %>%
    distinct(taxa) %>%
  DT::datatable()
```

So there are only 5 species reported to FAO, and they are all clams. 

Let's have a peek at the data: 

```{r mar_harvest_tonnes data, echo=FALSE}

mar_harvest_tonnes %>%
  select(-rgn_id, taxa_code) %>%
  group_by(taxa_code) %>%
  summarize(year_min = min(year),
            year_max = max(year),
            total_tonnes = sum(tonnes),
            mean_tonnes  = mean(tonnes)) %>%
  DT::datatable()
```

#### Discussion

- are better data available for these species?
- are there other species that should be represented in Samoa?

<br>

## [Lasting Special Places](http://ohi-science.org/ohi-global/goals.html#sense_of_place:_lasting_special_places)

The model measures the percentage of coastal marine protected area and protected coastline in each country, against a reference percentage. We focus only on coastal waters (within 3nmi of shore) for marine special places because it was assumed that lasting special places are primarily in coastal areas; we wanted our estimates of % area protected to be bounded to this coastal region. For coastlines, we focused only on the first km-wide strip of land as a way to increase the likelihood that the area being protected by terrestrial parks is connected to the marine system in some way.


### Global Data

Data is from the United Nations Environment Programme - World Conservation Monitoring Centre’s World Database on Protected Areas: [protectedplanet.net](http://www.protectedplanet.net). 

Data details: 

- includes all nationally designated (e.g., National Parks, Nature Reserves)
- includes internationally recognized protected areas (e.g., UNESCO World Heritage Sites, Ramsar Wetlands of International Importance)
- includes WDPA polygons only (excludes points)
- includes status of “designated” only (excludes “proposed”)

The model measures the percentage of coastal marine protected area and protected coastline in each country, against a reference percentage (30%). 

```{r lsp, echo=FALSE}
lsp_prot_area_inland1km <- lsp_prot_area_inland1km_csv %>%
  filter(rgn_id == rgn_global$rgn_id)

lsp_prot_area_offshore3nm <- lsp_prot_area_offshore3nm_csv %>%
  filter(rgn_id == rgn_global$rgn_id)

lsp_combo <- left_join(
  lsp_prot_area_inland1km,
  lsp_prot_area_offshore3nm, 
  by = c("rgn_id", "year")) %>%
  select(-rgn_id)
  
lsp_combo %>%
  DT::datatable()

```



There is a lag in the WDPA database, as discussed [in this article](https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/the-lag-effect-in-the-world-database-on-protected-areas). Therefore, Samoa may not have been included in previous datasets. 

Let's have a look at the data available now (I downloaded it as a CSV):

![](images/protectedplanet_sam.png)

```{r wdpa_sam, echo=FALSE}
wdpa <- read_csv("data/WDPA_May2018_search_ef5e1f4c6bafed1fc0d6e2e299c0d3db917c43a449f66e54b4989338cdaa1086-csv/WDPA_May2018_search_ef5e1f4c6bafed1fc0d6e2e299c0d3db917c43a449f66e54b4989338cdaa1086-csv.csv")

wdpa %>%
  DT::datatable()
```


![](data/WDPA_May2018_search_ef5e1f4c6bafed1fc0d6e2e299c0d3db917c43a449f66e54b4989338cdaa1086-csv/Resources_in_English/wdpa_Summary_table_WDPA_attributes.png)

#### Discussion

- are there other coastal or marine parks that are not accounted for? Discuss reporting, etc. 

- an example of adding data to LSP is available [here](https://rawgit.com/OHI-Science/sam/master/toolbox-demo/workshop-sub-data.html) (run from the master branch)

## Habitat-based goals

**Questions:**

- Which habitats are heavily gapfilled in HAB? (Or, which are not gapfilled in CP, CS?)

### Global Data

**[Carbon Storage](http://ohi-science.org/ohi-global/goals.html#carbon_storage)**: 3 coastal habitats: mangroves, seagrasses, and salt marshes

**[Coastal Protection](http://ohi-science.org/ohi-global/goals.html#coastal_protection)**: 5 coastal habitats: mangroves, seagrasses, salt marshes, coral reefs, and sea ice (although not in Samoa!)

**[Habitats (BD sub-goal)](http://ohi-science.org/ohi-global/goals.html#biodiversity:_habitats)**: 6 coastal habitats: mangroves, seagrasses, salt marshes, coral reefs, sea ice, and subtidal soft-bottom habitats

All models include Habitat Extent, which is not gapfilled, and is half of the calculation. But HAB is entirely modeled with Habitat Condition, which is all gapfilled for most places. 

Habitats are one of our worst data sets.
CP, CS goes down by ~50% because extent is ~50% of the score and extent is not gapfilled.

#### Habitat extent


```{r hab extent, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

  hab_seaice_extent,
  hab_softbottom_extent) 

hab_extent_samoa %>%
  DT::datatable()
```


#### Habitat health

Let's have a look at the data included for Samoa:

```{r hab health, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
## extract
hab_mangrove_health <- hab_mangrove_health_csv %>%
  filter(rgn_id == rgn_global$rgn_id)

hab_seagrass_health <- hab_seagrass_health_csv %>%
  filter(rgn_id == rgn_global$rgn_id)

hab_saltmarsh_health <- hab_saltmarsh_health_csv %>%
  filter(rgn_id == rgn_global$rgn_id)

hab_coral_health <- hab_coral_health_csv %>%
  filter(rgn_id == rgn_global$rgn_id)

hab_seaice_health <- hab_seaice_health_csv %>%
  filter(rgn_id == rgn_global$rgn_id)

hab_softbottom_health <- hab_softbottom_health_csv %>%
  filter(rgn_id == rgn_global$rgn_id)

hab_health_samoa <- rbind(
  hab_mangrove_health,
  hab_seagrass_health,
  hab_saltmarsh_health,
  hab_coral_health,
  hab_seaice_health,
  hab_softbottom_health) 

hab_health_samoa %>%
  DT::datatable()
```

So there is not a lot of data available for Samoa. This means that the goals are actually represented by this: 

**Carbon storage**: 2 coastal habitats: mangroves (but the data is 0), seagrasses

**Coastal Protection**: 3 coastal habitats: mangroves (but the data is 0), seagrasses, coral reefs

**Habitats sub-goal**: 3 coastal habitats: mangroves (but the data is 0), seagrasses, coral reefs




#### Discussion

- Are there better data available? 
- Should we look into the gapfilling question more?

## [Tourism & Recreation](http://ohi-science.org/ohi-global/goals.html#tourism__recreation)

TR is 100% gapfilled for Samoa.

**Questions:**

- What would be better ways to model TR for Samoa? What is important to capture?
- What data are available locally in Samoa?
- Is there local data to represent percent direct employment in tourism (tr_jobs_pct_tourism): Percent direct employment in tourism?

## Natural Products

### Global Data

Which Natural Products are included for Samoa?

```{r np, echo=FALSE}
np_harvest_tonnes <- np_harvest_tonnes_csv %>%
  filter(rgn_id == rgn_global$rgn_id)

np_harvest_tonnes %>%
  distinct(commodity, product) %>%
  DT::datatable()
```

So there are two products here.

We can also look at how much of this was gapfilled:
```{r np_gf, echo=FALSE}
## shows gapfilling too
np_harvest_tonnes %>%
  DT::datatable()

```

#### Discussion

- are there other products that should be included?
- is this a goal that represents Samoa well?

## Species-based goals

### Global data

```{r spp count, echo=FALSE}
## filter and join species name
rgn_spp_gl <- rgn_spp_gl_csv %>%
  filter(rgn_id == rgn_global$rgn_id) %>%
  left_join(ico_global_list %>%
              select(sciname, comname), 
            by = "sciname") %>%
  select(sciname, comname, iucn_sid, cat_score) # n_spp_rgn; this = n_rows: 1467 for samoa

rgn_spp_gl_distinct <- rgn_spp_gl %>%
  select(comname, sciname) %>% distinct() %>% data.frame()
```

```{r ico count, echo=FALSE}
## filter and join species name
ico_spp_iucn_status <- ico_spp_iucn_status_csv %>%
  filter(rgn_id == rgn_global$rgn_id) %>%
  left_join(ico_global_list %>%
              select(sciname, comname), 
            by = "sciname") %>%
  select(sciname, comname, iucn_sid, year, category)

ico_spp_iucn_status_distinct <- ico_spp_iucn_status %>%
  select(comname, sciname) %>% distinct() %>% data.frame()

```

**[Species subgoal of Biodiversity](http://ohi-science.org/ohi-global/goals.html#biodiversity:_species)**: There are `r nrow(rgn_spp_gl_distinct)` unique species for `r rgn_name`

**[Iconic Species subgoal of Sense of Place](http://ohi-science.org/ohi-global/goals.html#sense_of_place:_iconic_species)**: There are `r nrow(ico_spp_iucn_status_distinct)` unique species for `r rgn_name`

For Species, there are probably more than we can go through today. But, here is a table that has the full list:

```{r spp display, echo=FALSE}
## display
rgn_spp_gl %>%
  select(comname, sciname) %>%
  DT::datatable()
```

It might be more manageable to work with the Iconic Species list:

```{r ico display, echo=FALSE}
## join iucn category language
ico_spp_code <- ico_spp_iucn_status %>%
  dplyr::rename(cat_code = category) %>%
  left_join(risk_code_lookup %>%
              select(cat_code = code,
                     category, 
                     cat_score) %>%
              distinct(), 
            by = "cat_code")

## display
ico_spp_code %>%
  select(comname, sciname) %>% distinct() %>% #data.frame()
  DT::datatable()
```

Let's also look at this list in the [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1myCjWaUp6kXGMJbBOE3kOoZO_-miicKluN_2hlzcFVo/edit#slide=id.g39ed252120_0_195) since there are so many.


This is something that we could explore and we could potentially recalculate together. 

<!---
Recalculating would be easy for ICO bc no area-weighting. Could edit this file directly: ico_spp_iucn_status.csv bc read into ICO function. (NC/LV)

## Discussion and Next Steps

- We'll explore the "local" data you have for fisheries and other goals and see if we can incorporate this into the Toolbox. 
- we will capture the discussion we have, in particular about FP, TR, Habitat-based goals.


## Other topics (parking lot)

## Pressures and Resilience!

2017 report: 

- It has been suggested to not use bycatch data for OHI assessment.
- pollution

2016 report:

- crown of thorns
- coastal development

We can also look at the gapfilling plot above along with the global average. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
scores_gf_compare <- scores_gf_csv %>% 
  filter(region_id %in% c(rgn_global$rgn_id, 0),
         dimension == "status") %>%
  select(goal, region_id, percent_gapfilled = score) %>%
  arrange(region_id, percent_gapfilled) 

scores_compare <- scores_csv %>% 
  filter(region_id %in% c(rgn_global$rgn_id, 0),
         dimension == "status",  
         year == max(year)) %>%
  select(goal, region_id, score) %>%
  arrange(region_id) 

scores_plot_compare <- scores_compare %>%
  left_join(scores_gf_compare, by = c("goal", "region_id")) %>% 
  arrange(percent_gapfilled) %>%
  mutate(region_name = region_id) %>%
  mutate(region_name = str_replace_all(region_name, "152", "Samoa")) %>%
  mutate(region_name = str_replace_all(region_name, "0", "Global"))

ggplot(data = scores_plot_compare, aes(x = score, y = percent_gapfilled, label = goal, color = region_name)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_text(aes(label = goal), nudge_x = 3, nudge_y = 1)
```
