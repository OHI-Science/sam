**Observations:**

- Two goals are 100% gapfilled (TR, HAB)
- Samoa has a lot of goals (~11) with scores over 50 (on the x-axis)
- There are ~7 goals where % gapfilling is under 12.5% (on the y-axis)
- Some high-scoring goals have high % gapfilling, some have low

**Discussion:**

- What should we explore now that could help inform Tier 2 or OHI+?
