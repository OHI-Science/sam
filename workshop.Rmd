# Welcome

Welcome to the **Ocean Health Index Samoa Opportunities Training Workshop** in Apia, Samoa, from May 23-25, 2018.  

In this workshop we will do an in-depth exploration of OHI Global assessments and how they represent Samoa. We will also identify opportunites for Samoa, both conceptually (how does the  framework represent Samoa?) and technically (what data could we substitute)? We will also have some hands-on experience with the OHI Toolbox, and communicate next steps for OHI in Samoa.

<!---
During the three-day workshop we will:

1. Interpret global OHI scores for Samoa
2. Discuss whether all 10 goals should be included, remove any goals if not relevant
3. Identify which goals could be a priority to modify future work based on
4. Explore data for OHI Samoa
5. Hands-on with the Toolbox


[OHI Country Opportunities training materials](http://ohi-science.org/country-opportunities-training/) that we use to teach are online and available for you as a reference.
