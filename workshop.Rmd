# Welcome

Welcome to the **Ocean Health Index Samoa Opportunities Training Workshop** in Apia, Samoa, from May 21-23, 2018.  

In this workshop we will interpret and slightly tailor the OHI global input for Samoa. By the end of the workshop, we will also have some next steps for OHI Samoa. 

During the two-day workshop we will:

1. Interpret global OHI scores for Samoa
2. Discuss whether all 10 goals should be included, remove any goals if not relevant
3. Identify which goals could be a priority to modify future work based on
4. Modify the pressures and resilience measures included to better reflect Samoa

[OHI Country Opportunities training materials](http://ohi-science.org/country-opportunities-training/) that we use to teach are online and available for you as a reference.
