# Overview

To get some hands-on experience with the Toolbox, we will explore how Ocean Health Index (OHI) scores respond when add different data to the LSP goal.  

You will be using the OHI Toolbox software to do this, and follow the instructions here ([`workshop-toolbox.Rmd`](http://ohi-science.org/sam/workshop-toolbox)). We will walk through line-by-line together and execute the code in R; the order does matter so be sure to proceed line-by-line. 

Your final figures will be saved as .pngs within the `sam` folder you downloaded: `sam/toolbox-demo/reports/figures`. 


```{r setup, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
## hidden up here
library(devtools) 
library(ohicore)
source('plot_flower_local.r')
```

## Get the `sam` repository

We'll be playing with the Toolbox for the global OHI assessments; we calculate scores each year for 220 coastal nations and territories. We have copied this into a GitHub repository called `sam` for Samoa. Let's get it on your computer.

1. Go to [github.com/OHI-Science/sam](https://github.com/OHI-Science/sam). This is the `sam` repository (called 'repo'). 
2. Click on the <span style="color:green">green</span> 'clone or download' button. 
3. Clone or download somewhere you can find on your computer. If you are familiar with GitHub, clone this repository. Otherwise click 'Download ZIP'.
4. Navigate to where you saved the `sam` repo on your computer and rename it to `sam` if it has any other name. Double-click the `sam.Rproj` file. This will open [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) (which is how you should always interface with R). 
5. Within the RStudio file directory pane (bottom right), navigate to the `toolbox-demo` folder. Inside is a mix of `.R` scripts and `.csv` files. We will just focus on a few of them.


## Setup

Since we're in RStudio with a `.Rproj` file, our current working directory is `wherever/you/saved/it/sam`. All of our work in the Toolbox happens in the `toolbox-demo` folder within the `sam` folder. (Even [these instructions](https://github.com/OHI-Science/sam/blob/master/toolbox-demo/workshop-toolbox.Rmd) are within the `toolbox-demo` folder!) But we need to let R know that we want to be working inside the `toolbox-demo` folder. Let's change the working directory to the `toolbox-demo` folder, and install the packages we need to get going. 

Run the following code:
```{r ohicore, eval=FALSE}
## set working directory to sam/toolbox-demo with setwd()
setwd('toolbox-demo')

## install the packages we need. 

## tidyverse is by RStudio, for "data wrangling"
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)

## devtools helps install our ohicore software
install.packages('devtools') # do this just one time!
library(devtools) # do this every time you begin

devtools::install_github("ohi-science/ohicore@dev") # do this just one time!
library(ohicore) # do this every time you begin

## source the function to make flower plots; this won't do anything yet, but it makes it available to us.
source('plot_flower_local.r')
```

There are 220 countries that will be in our data set below, and we will just want to change information for Samoa. Samoa's region identifier number is 152 (full list [here](https://github.com/OHI-Science/sam/blob/master/toolbox-demo/layers/rgn_global.csv)).

```{r}
## identify region identifier for Samoa
rgn_id_sam <- 152
```

## LSP's new data

First read in new data. In this example we have saved the new WDPA data from May 2018 in a folder called workshop-data.

```{r read in}
wdpa <- read_csv("workshop-data/WDPA_May2018.csv")

wdpa %>%
  select(NAME, REP_M_AREA, STATUS, STATUS_YR, NO_TK_AREA)
```

Summarize the total areas within MPAs:

```{r total area}
mpa_area_total <- wdpa %>%
  group_by(STATUS_YR) %>%
  mutate(AREA_KM2 = sum(REP_M_AREA)) %>%
  select(NAME, REP_M_AREA, STATUS, STATUS_YR, NO_TK_AREA, AREA_KM2)
mpa_area_total

mpa_area_total_sam <- unique(mpa_area_total$AREA_KM2)
```

So since all were designated in the same year, `r mpa_area_total_sam` is the total recorded since 1999.

### Current Toolbox Data

Inspect LSP data layer: 

```{r inspect LSP data layer}
lsp_prot_area_offshore3nm <- read_csv("layers/lsp_prot_area_offshore3nm.csv")

## display
lsp_prot_area_offshore3nm  %>%
  filter(rgn_id == rgn_id_sam)
```


Since the WDPA data shows that all were designated in 1999, and the OHI LSP data layer begins with 2000, we can inject `r mpa_area_total_sam` for all years.

### Substitute new data

Inject in LSP data layer. 

```{r inject datalayer}
## base-R
# lsp_prot_area_offshore3nm$a_prot_3nm[lsp_prot_area_offshore3nm$rgn_id == rgn_id_sam] <- mpa_area_total_sam

## tidyverse
lsp_new <- rbind(
  lsp_prot_area_offshore3nm %>%
    filter(rgn_id != rgn_id_sam), 
  lsp_prot_area_offshore3nm %>%
    filter(rgn_id == rgn_id_sam) %>%
    mutate(a_prot_3nm = mpa_area_total_sam)) %>%
  arrange(rgn_id, year)

## save new data in existing layer
write_csv(lsp_new, "layers/lsp_prot_area_offshore3nm.csv")
```

We can check in the differences in GitHub and see that Samoa's data have been updated. 

###  Recalculate scores

```{r}
source("calculate_scores.R")

# visualize scores ----

## Flower plots for each region ----
source('plot_flower_local.R')

##  plot.
PlotFlower(region_plot = rgn_id_sam,
  assessment_name = "Samoa", 
  dir_fig_save = "reports/figures/flower_new")
```


Inspect new scores. The best way to do this is by looking at the GitHub differences in scores.csv and in the flower plot. 

The overall Index score changed slightly, and the LSP goal did as well. 

In this example, the change is too small to be visible in the flower plot, but that is what we would expect from such a small change in data. And LSP is just one goal.

We can also look at the scores in R:

```{r}
scores <- read_csv("scores.csv")

scores %>%
  filter(region_id == rgn_id_sam, 
         goal == "LSP")
```
